5. ActiveTransfer.ipynb  
Code to generate results presented in Figures 5~7.
Compares various active transfer learning strategies and analysis of the 'target tree growth' strategy.
* AL.py : 
Code for active learning. 
* compare_ATL_strategies.py : 
Plots the performance of each ATL strategy for finding desired reactions.
* passive_model_perf.py : 
Conducts iterative reaction selection suggested by the source model without any updates.
* update_combined_data.py : 
Conducts active transfer learning based on combined source and collected target data.
* eval_adaptability.py : 
Compares how models updated each iteration perform on the data in hand - source versus collected target.
* analyze_target_tree_growth.py : 
Analyzes the models of target tree growth strategy and the importance of model simplicity.
